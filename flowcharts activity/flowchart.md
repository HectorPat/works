## part 1

### silver

  1.	*Why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages,
       would normally use a high-level language when writing programs?*
      
- Because need a high speed to write the code and this one need velocity to read and execute 
on the machine. Commonly write on English code to make understandable.

  2.	*What is machine code?*

- Are the command base of the CPU that only uses binary code to operate, and are different of 
each device (laptops, stereo, CNC machine) 

  3.	*Give an example of a high-level language?*

- JavaScript: because the commands to use are intuitive, and reduce the time to program the 
action to do, and have predeterminate activities to do as math, interval, inputs, and 
human commands.

### gold

1.	*Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages?*

   - 1. the low-level use less memory to run the codes that the high-level.

   - 2. the low-level allows have control to modify specifics hardware components 
that the high-level.

   - 3. the high-level is easier to learn and understand to the programmers because use 
    alphabetical, numerical, and special characters that reduces time writing.

2.	*What does a translator do?*

- Transform the source code in a machine code.

3.	*Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code?*

  -  1.  Compiler (example: Microsoft visual studio)

  -  2.  Interpreter (example: python)

### platinum

1.	*What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?*

- The interpreter transforms each command line code into machine code that allows see 
the errors on it and needs the app to read and write, and the compiler transform all
the resource code to machine code making an executable that don´t needs a app to 
open it and avoid get the source code to copy it.

2.	*What is assembly language?*

- It´s a kind of machine code (low-level language) with a “human language” that allow 
program easily the hardware or modify them and are different of each architecture 
of processor.

3.	A developer is writing a program.

a.	The program is written in a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code.

*Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code?*

  - 1.	the machine code only uses binary code and the high-level language use “human language”
(English worlds, numbers, especial characters).

  - 2.	The high-level language has iteration constructs (Boolean operators or control structures)

b.	One type of translator is an interpreter.

i.	*Describe how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code?*

- Transform each command line to machine code and execute them. 

ii.	*State the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level 
code into machine code?*

- The compiler, that translate all the resource code into a executable that can be run faster after.

## part 2

1.  Describe in sheets of paper the representation of the control structures
 
 a) if-else
 
 https://github.com/HectorPat/works/blob/master/flowcharts%20activity/flowcharts%20images/if-else.jpg
 
 b) switch
 
 https://github.com/HectorPat/works/blob/master/flowcharts%20activity/flowcharts%20images/switch.jpg
 
 c) while
 https://github.com/HectorPat/works/blob/master/flowcharts%20activity/flowcharts%20images/while.jpg
 
 d) do-while
 
 https://github.com/HectorPat/works/blob/master/flowcharts%20activity/flowcharts%20images/do-while.jpg
 
 e) for
 
 https://github.com/HectorPat/works/blob/master/flowcharts%20activity/flowcharts%20images/for.jpg
 
2) Difference between:
  
  a)	*If-else vs switch*

- If-else make actions depending on if the result is true or false, meanwhile switch can choose and 
- option to do something or use a default option if no-one is chosen to do other action.
  
  b)	*While vs do-while vs for*
  
- While do an action depending on the result (true or false) and make a cycle.
- Do-while first do an action an after ask if is true or false to able make the cycle.
- FOR has stablish the number of cycles to do, what sentences is required and what will do.
 
3) 4 original flowcharts using at least two control structures (for this part include all previous 
flowcharts you drawed and showed in class, UPDATED)
